      <br />
      At RentYard, we believe in turning challenges into opportunities. The
      journey began in 2022 when I faced the struggles of being an international
      student searching for a suitable apartment near my university before even
      setting foot in the United States. It was a daunting task—navigating
      listings, managing time zone differences, and finding trustworthy
      information from afar.
      <br />
      <br />
      After arriving in the U.S., another challenge became clear: without a car,
      living close to campus is not just convenient—it’s essential. The
      importance of finding the right apartment, within walking distance or a
      short commute from school, was critical for daily life as a student.
      <br />
      <br />
      Realizing these were not just my struggles but shared pain points for
      thousands of international students, I decided to address the issue
      head-on. What started as a personal challenge soon transformed into a
      mission to simplify the process for students worldwide.
      <br />
      <br />
      Together with a passionate team, we embarked on this journey—from
      brainstorming on paper to sketching designs to developing a functional
      app. We conducted extensive research, listened to countless student
      experiences, and worked tirelessly to build a solution that bridges the
      gap between students and apartments near their universities.
      <br />
      <br />
      RentYard was born to empower students by providing a seamless, efficient,
      and reliable way to find and rent apartments, all before arriving in the
      U.S. But we didn’t stop there. RentYard also offers property owners and
      managers tools to streamline property management, creating a platform that
      benefits both tenants and landlords.
      <br />
      <br />
      Our mission is simple: to make renting effortless and stress-free while
      fostering connections between students and their future homes. This is
      more than a business—it’s a vision to transform student life and property
      management into a hassle-free experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      Welcome to RentYard—where finding home and managing property become
      smarter, simpler, and better.

      <p>
        In our apartment community, we uphold a comprehensive pet policy
        designed to accommodate our residents' furry companions while ensuring a
        harmonious living environment for all. We welcome both cats and dogs,
        subject to certain guidelines and restrictions. Each apartment is
        permitted a maximum of two pets, with considerations for size and breed
        restrictions to maintain safety and comfort. All pets must be up-to-date
        on vaccinations and properly licensed, promoting the health and
        well-being of our entire community.
        <br />
        To mitigate any potential disruptions, we require pet owners to
        responsibly manage their pets, including cleaning up after them in
        designated areas. Additionally, a pet deposit and monthly pet rent help
        cover any wear and tear that may occur as a result of pet ownership. By
        adhering to these policies, we strive to create a pet-friendly
        atmosphere where residents and their pets can enjoy a comfortable and
        respectful living experience together. Our goal is to foster a sense of
        community among all residents, whether they have pets or not, ensuring
        everyone can feel at home in our apartment complex.
